    <h2>How long does the bootcamp take to complete?</h2>
    <p>We teach the course in person over 12 weeks. But we have seen
        students online complete the course as quickly as 3 weeks. It
        depends if you are going to work full-time or part-time. It can also
        be helpful to read around the topics and do more self-directed
        research and experimentation.</p>
    <h2>I don't have any prior experience or a technical
        background, can I join the bootcamp?</h2>
        <p>The course is designed for students of all levels. The youngest
            person we've had on the course is 11, the oldest 86. The most
            inexperienced student didn't know what a website is, the most
            experienced works for Twitter as a developer. The most important
            thing is perseverance and willingness to learn. If you have that
            then you'll do great!</p>
